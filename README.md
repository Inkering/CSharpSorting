# CSharpSorting
A library for sorting algorithms in C#

Erik Boesen wrote a great library of a few sorting algorithims in java. He is using his as an aid in his classwork. I will be doing the same, but wanted a few more algorithims and I needed to adapt it to c# for my purposes. However, to echo his remarks, 

"Please DO NOT use this in classes if you don't fully understand how it works. Array sorting is an important concept to understand. Use this only if you have a full understanding of what it does and it's only going to save you time and not rob you of your education."

Please follow the same suggestions for this library. Cheers!

## How to Use
'SortedArray = sort.SortingType(UnsortedArray);

Available algorithms are:
* 'bubble'
* 'selection'
* 'insertion'
* '... more to come as I need them'
